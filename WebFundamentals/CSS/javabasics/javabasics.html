      <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting langauge.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server>, it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="code">var x;</span></li>
      
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="code"> var x = 10</span></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false;</span> null - <span class="code">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="code">42</span> or <span class="code">3.14159;</span> String = <span class="code">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="code">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="code">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: "Doe"}</span></li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span id="code">if </span>a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="code">else if </span> to specifiy a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="code">else </span>we execute this block of code;</li>
        

        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done!  We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
